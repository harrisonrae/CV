 <p>'Gomi' was a show by Harrison Rae exploring the materiality of garbage. </p>
  <p></p>In 'Gomi', Rae showcased a collection of flags, kites and quilts, items made during his time as artist in residence at Studio Kura.
       
       <p></p> Drawing upon the history of boro as a traditional handcraft, 'Gomi' explored the transformative potential of discarded materials and highlights the artistry and cultural resonance of repair and renewal.
                
        <p></p>'Gomi' tied the domestic to the global through considering creative approaches to the challenges of sustainability, and uses flags, kites and quilts as objects to connect the past with the present.</p>
