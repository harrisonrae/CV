“It matters what stories make worlds, what worlds make stories.”
<p></p>
Myths are stories; considered and condensed, with details and perspectives omitted by a mythmaker. The ability of myth as a tool is that it can distort and change what an image or phrase signifies. It erases the complexities of human actions to create worlds without contradiction.
<p></p>
Roland Boer writes in 'The Robbery of Language' that the crafting of “a world without contradiction” is an undeniable acknowledgement of the undercurrent of oppositional perspectives erased in favour of a singular vision. Boer posits that within myth there are opportunities for using counter-myth as a means to resist the erasure of other perspectives.
<p></p>
Myth & Signification invites four artists to approach myth and counter-myth as building blocks for crafting oppositional worlds, to contest the creation of a world without contradiction and resist the homogenisation of perspectives.
<p></p>
Together Astrid Elouise Bell, Sydney Jarrett, Nic Narapiromkwan Foo & Harrison Rae craft their own worlds of contradictions through myth and counter-myth. A world resisting the homogenisation of perspectives, the gendering of bodies, and the exploitation of land and labour.
