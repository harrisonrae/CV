  <h1>Family Photo (2026)</h1>

  <!-- parent container for text and image -->
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px;">

    <div style="flex: 1; max-width: 600px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5;">
      <p>
        Family photos were once material relics, items kept in shoeboxes and bedside tables to share amongst private company.
       These digital photos are no longer shared in private company, but are on servers and databases maintained by private companies. 
        In Camera Lucida, Roland Barthes resists sharing photos of his mother in the publication. A refusal of such a reproduction [and the images consequent circulation] denies the potential category error a viewer could bring to the image. 
        I wondered what Barthes would think about the urge to digitise archives and family photos?

    <p>
        In this series of works I take photos that have been digitised and circulated by my immediate family, negotiating with Barthean ideas of punctum and studium, and the idea of the family photo as something that can wound.
